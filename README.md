# Lottery_Numbers_Generator
A JavaFx application that generates numbers based on the type of lotto game you want to play (UK Lotto)

The user will be able to generate numbers for two of the most played lotto games in the UK - EuroMillions and SetForLife.

If you decide to play the generated numbers don't forget to save them as 'played'. This can be done 
using the 'save' option in the file menu. A new file called my-played-numbers.txt will be created
in the current folder with a record of the numbers and the date they were played.
Future saved numbers will be appended to this file.

Before playing or saving the numbers the user can check if he/she already played these by using
the 'check numbers' option in the 'check' menu.

To run the app simply download the 'numbers_generator' folder, open your terminal and cd to numbers_generator/bin/
and run ./launcher.sh
